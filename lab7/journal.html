        <p>
            I went home for the weekend to stock on supplies for the dorm like toilet paper, rice, and instant noodles. My dad also made some good bamboo soup and pork that I ate and I will also be taking the leftovers to school too!

        <cite>August 27, 2023</cite>
        <p>Today is my move-in day! Excited to see my new dorm because we got lucky and were able to get a suite for me and my roommate. This is a huge upgrade from last years dorm. I hope nothing breaks while moving everything in!</p>

        <h2>Long Run Day</h2>
        <cite>November 6, 2023</cite>
        <p>I went on a long run along the piers in Hoboken today. I started off by running north of campus then went down towards the station. Since today was a long run day, I also ran into Newport and then came back up through Hoboken to get back to campus.</p>
